Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 In recent years, the corridor has become a major bottleneck for traffic, with over half of the entire 75 mile stretch having failing or near failing levels of service and continued increased safety concerns.[16] In 2011, VDOT initiated a study that would consider widening the highway with either additional general purpose lanes in the median and/or on the outside shoulder, adding a two laned, fully reversible managed lanes (either as an tolled express lane or an HOT lane facility), or the addition of full tolling on the entire span.[17] The approved plan selected by VDOT and partners included the plan that added an additional general purpose lane in each direction by either expanding into the median or on the outside shoulder.[18] 
In June 2013, the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) included $100 million in funding for the project in its Six-Year Improvement Program, allowing the project to move forward into the design and build phases

Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 After I-264, there are no more directional markers on I-64 from here to its "eastern" terminus, because I-64 "east" will actually head west after its current southward course, and vice versa

Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 Similar to I-64 west of Newport News on the Peninsula, VDOT and the HRTPO undertook environmental and preliminary engineering studies for the improvement of the 8 mile, 48 year old corridor of the I-64 from Interstate 464 in Chesapeake to the Bowers Hill Interchange
Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 The Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization (HRTPO) allocated an additional $44 million to Segment I of the project to extend the boundaries beyond the Fort Eustis interchange.[19] The project is broken down into three operationally independent segments, which are independently funded, designed and built by a different company.

Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 17 interchange in Chesapeake to the Bowers Hill Interchange in Suffolk.

Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 Both of the bypass routes are shorter than the main leg for through traffic - I-664 is about 15 miles (24 km) shorter than the bypassed main leg while I-264 is about a mile (1.6 km) shorter than the main leg it bypasses.

Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 Also noteworthy is a section through Rockfish Gap, a wind gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains, which was equipped with an innovative system of airport-style runway lighting embedded into the pavement to aid motorists during periods of poor visibility due to fog or other conditions.

Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 Segment 2: Virginia Beach/Chesapeake & High Rise Bridge

Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 From Staunton, I-64 leaves I-81 and passes through Waynesboro and crosses Rockfish Gap and continues eastward, passing just to the south of Charlottesville, closely following the path of the historic colonial-era Three Notch'd Road, which had been established in the Colony of Virginia by the 1730s, and was largely replaced in the 1930s by U.S
Interstate_64_(Virginia)	 This study, completed in 2013, showed that the corridor frequently performed at near-failing levels of service (LOS grades D and E), with the High Rise Bridge itself outright failing, resulting in higher crash rates when compared to other areas in the region.[23] This is because most of the interchange ramps were built to previous interstate standards and were based on then-rural development in the Western Chesapeake and Eastern Suffolk.[24] In addition, since the start of tolling at the Elizabeth River Tunnels, the High Rise Bridge and the corridor has received a nearly 7% increase in traffic during peak hours, further exacerbating the problem.[25]
